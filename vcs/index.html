    <p>Version control systems are a category of software tools
        that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version 
        control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a 
        special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back 
        the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake 
        while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p>
